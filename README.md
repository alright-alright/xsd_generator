Here's a sample `README.md` for your `xsd_parser` project, including instructions for usage and details about the functionality:

# XSD Parser

`xsd_parser` is a Python script designed to parse an XML file, extract its structure, and generate an initial XML Schema Definition (XSD). This tool helps in understanding and defining the structure of XML data, making it useful for validating health record exports or other XML-based data files.

## Features
- Parses XML files to identify elements, attributes, and their hierarchy.
- Generates a basic XSD template based on the parsed structure.
- Outputs an XSD file that can be further refined for specific use cases.
- Provides detailed output on the XML structure for verification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module (standard Python library)

## Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xsd_parser.git
cd xsd_parser
```

## Usage
1. Place the XML file you want to parse in the `xsd_parser` directory.
2. Run the `xsd_parser.py` script with the XML file as an argument:

```bash
python xsd_parser.py path/to/your/exported_health_record.xml
```

### Example Command
```bash
python xsd_parser.py exported_health_record.xml
```

### Output
- The script will print the parsed XML structure to the terminal for verification.
- An XSD template will be generated and displayed in the terminal.
- The generated XSD template will be saved to a file named `generated_schema.xsd` in the current directory.

## Output Format
The output XSD will include:
- Elements with their tags.
- Nested structure representing the hierarchy.
- Sample attributes detected in the XML.
- Data types default to `xs:string` with `minOccurs="0"` for flexibility.

## Customization
You can modify the script to:
- Handle specific data types based on content.
- Add more complex type definitions and constraints.
- Include attributes and any additional XSD rules.

## Example Output
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified">
  <xs:element name="PatientRecord">
    <xs:complexType>
      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="patient_id" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0"/>
        <xs:element name="symptom" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0"/>
        <xs:element name="timestamp" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0"/>
      </xs:sequence>
    </xs:complexType>
  </xs:element>
</xs:schema>
```
